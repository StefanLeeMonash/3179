                  <p>Age can be seen to have a minimal impact on whether or not individuals seek treatment from a professional. Aside from the 15-27 age group in 2016, a trend can be identified where those who are older are more likely to seek treatment. This is especially the case for the elderly within the 65-77 age range, where 100% of those individuals sought treatment for their mental health in 2017 and 2018.</p>

                    <p>It can be seen that Males typically sought treatment the least while those who identified as LGBTQI+ sought treatment the most. This was consistent over the three-year period, where those who identified as LGBTQI+ sought treatment the most, followed by Females and lastly Men. Over the three years the proportion of individuals from each gender that sought out treatment remained relatively similar, with a spike to 94% during 2017 for those who identified as LGBTQI+.</p>

        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Percentage</strong> of people who sought <strong>treatment</strong> in <strong>2014</strong> around the globe</p>
        <p class="center">From those who were surveyed, it is evident that it was more common for individuals from Western countries, such as USA and Canada, to seek out treatment compared to those from Asia. This could be due to cultural differences where greater emphasis is placed on mental health and is more widely accepted within communities. There were however a few outliers such as Japan, where mental health has already been identified as a serious ongoing issue.</p>

        <p class="center">Over the years, it is evident that people are the least comfortable with sharing their mental health issues with others. This is a serious issue and signifies the importance of investing more resources into mental health and wellbeing programs within companies.</p>

                <p>As expected, individuals where all past employers provided them with mental health resources experienced the highest average willingness to share the fact that they were suffering from a mental illness. However, they also experienced the lowest average willingness during 2017 and 2021 which is very unexpected and unusual. Overall, the data shows that the provision of health resources had a minimal effect on the willingness of individuals to speak out.</p>
